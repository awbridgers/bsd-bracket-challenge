### Bracket Challenge 2020
The 2019 global pandemic cancelled the NCAA Tournament, and with it, the best part of March Madness: brackets.
 This is a simple app designed to mimic that of an ESPN or CBS online bracket to allow users of [Blogger So Dear](https://www.bloggersodear.com/) fill out brackets and compete like normal. 

 ### How To Use
 * This app is similar to any other March Madness online bracket.
 * Make picks by clicking on the team that you believe will win to advance them to the next stage.
 * Clicking the same team twice will undo the selection
 * Fill out the entire bracket, enter a name, and click 'submit' to be entered into the contest.
 * As the game aren't actually being played, College Hoops 2k8 on XBox 360 will be used to simulate the game
 * Points are awarded for correct picks increasing in value by round
 * You can view other player's brackets by selecting them on the leaderboard.
